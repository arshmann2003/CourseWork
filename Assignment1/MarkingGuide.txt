CMPT 213 Assignment 1 Marking Guide
Must be done individually.

Total =  [25] marks.

[20] Game Tracker Functionality
   [5] Robust keyboard input: when given a number out of range it gracefully asks for retry.
      (need not handle invalid types, like "hi" for a number)
   [5] Able to add and remove games.
   [5] Able to a game played to a game correctly.
   [5] Good listing of games, and debug listing (using toString()).

[5] Code Quality and Style Guide
    * Reasonable object oriented structure 
      - must at least 3 non-trivial classes.
    * Very minor violations of style guide have no penalty 
      (ex: having "int myCount=0;" (spacing wrong) a couple times)
    * Lose a few marks for consistent problems 
      (like always getting the spacing wrong).
    * Larger penalties possible for horrific code (max 0 on assignment)

    Some specifics to check with suggested deductions
    -1 Poor/missing JavaDoc comment on a class (not needed on methods/fields)
    -2 Incorrect indentation, brackets, or spacing (use IDE's reformat if needed).
    -2 Poor intention revealing class, method, or variable names.
    -2 Functions should not be longer than about 30 lines long.
    -2 Lines of code should not be longer than about 120 characters long.
    -2 Code should not be more than 3 control structures deep (ex: if in loop in an if).
    -2 Your class’s toString() method may only be printed to the screen as part of the 
       “Debug dump” option; otherwise it should be your UI code that is generating screen output.
